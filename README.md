# MDATA-GETTER
A tool for getting files from search engines like Google and Bing, and check the metadata contained in them

## Usage
```bash
./mdata-getter TARGET_DOMAIN FILE_TYPES BROWSER_ID
```
- **TARGET_DOMAIN**: you can set whatever domain you'd like to search files for
- **FILE_TYPES**: any number of file types, separated by a comma (pdf,docx,xlsx,txt...)
- **BROWSER_ID**: this one is tricky
